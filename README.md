## Video URL Extraction & Download Workflow

This section explains how to extract video URLs from Reddit saved links CSV files and download the actual video content.

### Prerequisites

1. **Reddit Saved Links CSV Files**: Place your Reddit saved links CSV files in the `reddit-links/` directory
2. **CSV Format**: Files should contain Reddit URLs in one of these formats:
   ```csv
   # Format 1: key, URL
   video1,https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/id/title/
   video2,https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/id/title/
   
   # Format 2: id, permalink
   1,https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/id/title/
   2,https://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/comments/id/title/
   ```

### Step 1: Extract Video URLs from Reddit Posts

```bash
# Extract video URLs from all CSV files in reddit-links/
npm run extract-all-videos
```

**What this does:**
- Reads all CSV files from `reddit-links/` directory
- Processes each Reddit URL to extract video content
- Supports multiple video platforms:
  - **Reddit videos** (v.redd.it)
  - **RedGIFs** (media.redgifs.com, watch.redgifs.com)
  - **Other video platforms**
- Saves results to:
  - `all-extracted-video-urls.txt` - Complete list with post titles
  - `extracted-video-urls-batch-*.txt` - Batch files for large datasets
  - `failed-extraction-requests.txt` - Failed requests for retry

**Example Output:**
```
üìÅ Found 2 CSV files in reddit-links/
üìÑ Processing: saved_posts.csv
üìÑ Processing: saved_comments.csv
üé¨ Processing post 1/100: "Amazing Reddit Video"
‚úÖ Found 2 video URLs
üé¨ Processing post 2/100: "Another Great Video"
‚úÖ Found 1 video URL
...
üíæ Saved batch 1: 50 posts with video URLs to extracted-video-urls-batch-1.txt
üíæ Saved final batch: 100 posts with video URLs to extracted-video-urls-batch-final.txt
üíæ Saved all URLs to all-extracted-video-urls.txt
```

### Step 2: Deduplicate and Select Best Quality

```bash
# Remove duplicates and select highest quality versions
npm run deduplicate-urls
```

**What this does:**
- Removes duplicate video URLs
- Selects highest quality versions (1080p > 720p > 480p, etc.)
- Prioritizes RedGIFs over Reddit videos (typically better quality)
- Saves deduplicated list to `deduplicated-video-urls.txt`

**Example Output:**
```
üìÑ Loaded 912 URLs from all-extracted-video-urls.txt
üîç Processing 912 URLs...
‚úÖ Found 488 unique videos
üíæ Saved deduplicated URLs to deduplicated-video-urls.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Videos

#### Option A: Download with Custom Naming (Recommended)

```bash
# Download videos using post titles as filenames
npm run ytdlp-download -- --deduplicated
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads videos from `deduplicated-video-urls.txt`
- Uses Reddit post titles as filenames
- Handles duplicate filenames by appending numbers
- Saves to `downloads/Videos/` directory

#### Option B: Download with Default Naming

```bash
# Download videos with default yt-dlp naming
npm run ytdlp-download
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads videos from `all-extracted-video-urls.txt`
- Uses yt-dlp default naming convention
- Saves to `downloads/Videos/` directory

### Step 4: Organize Downloaded Videos

```bash
# Organize videos by celebrity names and move rest to "other" folder
npm run organize-videos-custom
```

**What this does:**
- Creates celebrity-based folders (e.g., `ana-de-armas/`, `charlotte-le-bon/`)
- Moves remaining videos to `other/` folder
- Provides clean, organized structure

### Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete example of extracting and downloading videos from Reddit saved links:

```bash
# 1. Extract video URLs from CSV files
npm run extract-all-videos

# 2. Deduplicate and select best quality
npm run deduplicate-urls

# 3. Download videos with custom naming
npm run ytdlp-download -- --deduplicated

# 4. Organize videos by celebrity names
npm run organize-videos-custom

# 5. Move GIFs to dedicated folder
npm run move-gifs

# 6. Fix any corrupted files
npm run fix-corrupted-files
```

### Advanced Options

#### Batch Processing for Large Datasets

```bash
# Process only first 50 URLs (for testing)
npm run extract-all-videos -- --limit 50

# Process URLs starting from offset 100
npm run extract-all-videos -- --offset 100 --limit 50

# Add delay between requests (avoid rate limiting)
npm run extract-all-videos -- --delay 2000
```

#### Retry Failed Operations

```bash
# Retry failed URL extractions
npm run retry-failed-extraction

# Retry failed video downloads
npm run retry-failed-downloads
```

#### Quality Selection

```bash
# Test quality selection for specific URLs
npm run test-quality-selection

# Test video download functionality
npm run test-video-download
```

### Output Files

After running the extraction workflow, you'll have:

- **`all-extracted-video-urls.txt`** - Complete list with post titles
- **`deduplicated-video-urls.txt`** - Clean, high-quality URLs
- **`failed-extraction-requests.txt`** - Failed requests for retry
- **`downloads/Videos/`** - Downloaded video files
- **`downloads/Videos/[celebrity-name]/`** - Organized celebrity folders
- **`downloads/Videos/other/`** - Miscellaneous videos

### Troubleshooting

#### Rate Limiting Issues
- Use `--delay` option to add delays between requests
- Reddit API has rate limits, so processing large datasets takes time

#### Failed Downloads
- Check `failed-video-downloads.txt` for failed URLs
- Use `npm run retry-failed-downloads` to retry
- Some videos may be deleted or private

#### Memory Issues with Large Datasets
- Use batch processing with `--limit` and `--offset`
- Process in smaller chunks to avoid memory issues
