# üìã Past Context - Reddit Media Saver

## üîß **Recently Fixed Issues**

### **JPG File Corruption Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ**
**Problem**: Some image files were being saved as `.jpg` but contained HTML/text content instead of actual image data, making them unopenable.

**Root Cause**: The download service was not properly validating downloaded content. When Reddit URLs returned HTML pages (error pages, redirect pages, or access denied pages) instead of actual media, the system still saved them with `.jpg` extensions.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Content Validation**: Added `isHtmlOrTextContent()` method to detect HTML/text content
2. **Improved File Type Detection**: Updated `detectMediaTypeFromResponse()` to use content validation
3. **Enhanced File Saving**: Text content saved as UTF-8 text files, binary content saved as-is
4. **Corrupted File Fixer**: Created script to identify and fix existing corrupted files

**Results**:
- **33 corrupted files** identified and fixed
- New downloads properly detect HTML content and save as text files
- No more corrupted image files created

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/contentDownloadService.ts` - Added content validation methods
- `src/scripts/fixCorruptedFiles.ts` - New script to fix corrupted files
- `package.json` - Added `fix-corrupted-files` script

**Test Results** (100 files batch test):
- **67% success rate** (67 out of 100 URLs processed successfully)
- **0 corrupted files created** - fix working perfectly
- **47+ HTML files properly detected** and saved as `.txt` files
- **15+ actual images downloaded** with correct `.jpg` extensions

### **Video Download Issues - PARTIALLY RESOLVED ‚úÖ**
**Problem**: Videos were being saved as text files or corrupted HTML files, causing VLC to show "Codec not supported" errors.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **RedGIFs videos**: Working fine, but had double `.mp4.mp4` extensions due to filename generation bug
2. **Reddit packaged videos**: Working fine with proper quality selection (1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.)
3. **Base Reddit URLs**: Returning HTML pages instead of video files (causing VLC errors)

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed filename generation**: RedGIFs URLs now extract proper filenames without double extensions
2. **Updated quality selection**: Avoids base Reddit URLs that return HTML, prefers packaged media URLs
3. **Improved video extraction**: Better handling of HTML content from video URLs
4. **Enhanced error handling**: Skips corrupted downloads instead of failing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/mediaUtils.ts` - Fixed filename generation for RedGIFs URLs
- `src/services/contentDownloadService.ts` - Updated video extraction and quality selection
- `src/scripts/downloadExtractedVideos.ts` - Created script to download extracted video URLs

**Test Results**:
- **23 successful video downloads** with proper quality selection
- **14 videos skipped** that only had base Reddit URLs (which return HTML)
- **0 corrupted downloads** - all videos are proper MP4 files with H.264 codec
- **Fixed double extension issue** - RedGIFs files now have correct `.mp4` extensions

**Video Analysis Results**:
- RedGIFs videos: ‚úÖ Working perfectly (H.264 codec, proper MP4 structure)
- Reddit packaged videos: ‚úÖ Working perfectly (H.264 codec, proper MP4 structure)
- Base Reddit URLs: ‚ùå Return HTML pages, not video files

## üêõ **Current Issues Identified**

### **Issue #1: VLC Still Can't Play Videos**
**Problem**: Despite downloading proper video files with H.264 codec, VLC still shows "Codec not supported" error.

**Evidence**:
- Video files are proper MP4 with H.264 codec (confirmed via ffprobe)
- File sizes are correct (1MB-57MB range)
- Video files have proper MP4 structure and metadata
- VLC error: "VCodec not supported: VLC could not decode the format 'h264'"

**Potential Causes**:
1. **H.264 Profile Issue**: Videos may use H.264 profiles that VLC doesn't support
2. **Container Format Issue**: MP4 container might have compatibility issues
3. **VLC Version Issue**: Older VLC version might not support the H.264 profile used
4. **Codec Parameters**: Specific H.264 parameters might be incompatible

**Next Steps Needed**:
1. **Analyze H.264 profile**: Check the specific H.264 profile used in downloaded videos
2. **Test with different players**: Try playing videos with other media players
3. **Check VLC version**: Verify if VLC version supports the H.264 profile
4. **Consider re-encoding**: May need to re-encode videos to more compatible format

### **Issue #2: Large Text Files in Notes Directory**
**Problem**: The `downloads/Notes/` directory contains large files (500KB+) that appear to be HTML pages with embedded video content.

**Evidence**:
- Large text files (500KB+) in Notes directory
- Files contain HTML with embedded video URLs
- Analysis revealed **116 video URLs** embedded in HTML content
- These are Reddit video pages that contain actual video URLs

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `src/scripts/analyzeLargeTextFiles.ts` to extract video URLs from HTML
- Created `src/scripts/downloadExtractedVideos.ts` to download extracted videos
- Successfully extracted and downloaded **23 proper video files**

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Video URLs successfully extracted and downloaded
