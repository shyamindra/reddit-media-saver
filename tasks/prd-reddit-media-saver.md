# Product Requirements Document: Reddit Media Saver App

## Introduction/Overview

The Reddit Media Saver App is a desktop application that allows users to download and organize their saved Reddit content locally. The app addresses the problem of losing access to valuable saved content when posts or comments are deleted from Reddit. Users can authenticate with their Reddit account, download all their saved posts, comments, and media, and organize them by subreddit or category for easy offline access.

## Goals

2. **Local Organization**: Provide intuitive organization of saved content by subreddit and category
3. **Offline Access**: Allow users to browse and search their saved content without internet connection
4. **User Privacy**: Ensure secure handling of Reddit credentials and user data
5. **Ease of Use**: Create a simple, intuitive interface for non-technical users
